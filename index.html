        <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am a full Stack Web Developer based out of Orange County, CA. I graduated with a bachelor's degree
            in Kinesiology, option in Exercise Science from California State University, Long Beach. While working at my
            previos job as a Loan Consultant at a techfin start-up, I got to see first hand how software engineering was
            changing the world by making the process me efficient. This resonated with me and I have since transitioned
            to becoming a software engineer because of my passion for solving problems and creating innovative
            solutions. While learning how to code, I have become infatuated with the potential this technology has to
            pushing our society into a better world. As a result, my goal is to use my skills to create a better
            experience for people. Outside of coding, I love to attend music festivals, workout, snowboard, train
            jiu-jitsu, play video games, surf, and travel!
